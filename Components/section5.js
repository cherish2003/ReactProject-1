              It's forced us to think about new ways that collaborating and team
              bonding can work â€” asynchronously and remotely. One of the biggest
              things we've realized is that it's not just about applying the way
              we used to work in the office to online settings, but also about
              finding ways of working and collaborating.

              Real time collaboration empowers employees, teams to come together
              and collaborate on a single digital platform independent of their
              individual locations. It allows multiple users to work
              simultaneously on projects in secure workspaces, without having to
              rely on face-to-face communication.
